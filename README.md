   - Automatic detection and extraction
   - Returns decoded text/URL

## Quick Start Guide

### Example 1: Text Watermark Workflow

**Embed Text:**
1. Load your image using "Load Image" node
2. Add "📝 Embed Text Watermark" node
3. Connect the image and enter:
   - **Watermark Text**: "Copyright 2025"
   - **Password**: 12345
   - **d1/d2**: Use defaults (36/20) or adjust
4. Save the watermarked image

**Extract Text:**
1. Load the watermarked image
2. Add "📖 Extract Text Watermark" node
3. Enter the same password and text length
4. View extracted text in output

### Example 2: Image Watermark Workflow

**Embed Image:**
1. Load the original image
2. Load your watermark/logo image
3. Add "🖼️ Embed Image Watermark" node
4. Connect both images
5. Set password and embedding strength
6. Save the result

**Extract Image:**
1. Load the watermarked image
2. Add "🔍 Extract Image Watermark" node
3. Enter password and watermark dimensions
4. View extracted watermark

### Example 3: QR Code Watermark

1. Generate a QR code with "📲 Generate QR Code"
2. Use it as watermark with "🖼️ Embed Image Watermark"
3. Extract and decode with "🔍 Extract Image Watermark" → "🔍 Decode QR Code"

## Parameters Explained

### Password Parameters
- **password_img**: Password for image encryption (integer)
- **password_wm**: Password for watermark encryption (integer)
- Both passwords must match between embed and extract operations

### Embedding Strength (d1/d2)
- **d1**: Controls frequency coefficient range (default: 36)
- **d2**: Controls embedding strength (default: 20)
- **Higher values** = stronger watermark, more visible
- **Lower values** = weaker watermark, more invisible
- Recommended: d1=36, d2=20 for balanced results

### DCT Coefficient Modes
- **Mode 1**: Uses fewer coefficients (faster, less robust)
- **Mode 2**: Uses more coefficients (slower, more robust)
- **Mode 3**: Uses even more coefficients (slowest, most robust)

### Processing Modes
- **Single Process**: Standard processing
- **Multi-core**: Parallel processing for faster embedding
- **All Cores**: Uses all available CPU cores

## Watermark Robustness

This watermark technique is resistant to:

| Attack Type | Robustness | Notes |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| 🔄 Rotation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Survives moderate rotation |
| ✂️ Cropping | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Highly resistant |
| 📏 Scaling | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Survives resize operations |
| 🎭 Masking | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Partial watermark still recoverable |
| 📦 Compression | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Survives JPEG compression |
| 🌈 Brightness/Contrast | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Unaffected by color adjustments |
| 🔊 Noise | ⭐⭐⭐ | Moderate resistance |

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results:

1. **Password Management**
   - Use the same passwords for embedding and extraction
   - Record passwords securely
   - Higher passwords = more security

2. **Watermark Length**
   - Keep text watermarks concise (< 100 characters)
   - Longer watermarks require larger images
   - Note the reported `wm_bit_length` after embedding

3. **Image Quality**
   - Use high-resolution images (minimum 512×512)
   - Avoid heavily compressed images as input
   - Save watermarked images in lossless formats (PNG)

4. **Embedding Strength**
   - Start with defaults (d1=36, d2=20)
   - Increase d2 if extraction fails
   - Decrease d2 if watermark is visible

5. **Image Watermarks**
   - Use simple, high-contrast watermark images
   - Recommended watermark size: 64×64 or 128×128
   - Black and white logos work best

## Troubleshooting

### Watermark Extraction Failed

**Problem**: Extracted text is garbled or empty

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Verify passwords match exactly
- ✅ Check `wm_bit_length` parameter
- ✅ Ensure image hasn't been re-encoded multiple times
- ✅ Try increasing embedding strength (d2)
- ✅ Use the same DCT mode for embed/extract

### Watermark Visible in Image

**Problem**: Watermark creates visible artifacts

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Reduce d2 parameter (e.g., from 20 to 15)
- ✅ Use a smaller watermark
- ✅ Ensure input image is high quality

### Node Not Appearing

**Problem**: Nodes don't show up in ComfyUI

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Check `requirements.txt` packages are installed
- ✅ Restart ComfyUI completely
- ✅ Check console for error messages
- ✅ Verify folder is in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`

## Technical Details

This plugin uses frequency domain watermarking based on:
- **DWT** (Discrete Wavelet Transform)
- **DCT** (Discrete Cosine Transform)
- **SVD** (Singular Value Decomposition)

The watermark is embedded in the frequency domain, making it invisible to the human eye while being detectable with the correct password.
